# Trafficelligence: Advanced Traffic Volume Estimation with Machine Learning

Trafficelligence is a machine learning-based web application that estimates traffic volume using environmental and temporal data. The system aims to assist city planners, traffic departments, and researchers in predicting traffic flow efficiently.

## 🚦 Problem Statement

Managing traffic in urban areas is increasingly challenging due to rapid urbanization, vehicle growth, and unpredictable patterns. Traditional traffic estimation methods often fail to scale or adapt to real-time environmental conditions. This project aims to provide an intelligent solution by using machine learning algorithms to predict traffic volume based on various influencing factors.

## 💡 Solution Overview

Our application:
- Takes inputs like temperature, rain, snow, holiday info, and time features.
- Uses a trained machine learning regression model to predict traffic volume.
- Is deployed using Flask and supports a simple web interface for user interaction.

## 🔧 Features

- Input environmental & time data through a simple UI
- Predicts traffic volume instantly
- Clean and lightweight Flask web app
- Model trained using various regression algorithms
